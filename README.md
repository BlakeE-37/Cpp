# Overview
I wrote this prgram to show what I have learned about the c++ language. 

I wrote a program that mimics a login page. You cannot actually loggin into anything with this program but it uses functions, some built in classes, varibales and other basic c++ programming. 

Here is a link to a video where I show off my program.
